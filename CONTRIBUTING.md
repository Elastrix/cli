# Bugs

Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome. When filing a bug, try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The date/commit of the code you're running
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

# Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome!

You should open an issue to discuss your pull request, unless it's a trivial change. It's best to ensure that your proposed change would be accepted so that you don't waste your own time. If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not yet available, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any duplication of effort. 

Pull requests should generally be opened against **master**.

## Code Style

Generally, match the style of the surrounding code, since everything is written in Bash script.
